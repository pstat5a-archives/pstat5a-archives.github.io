For example, $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cup \\{4, 5\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n    \n    - Mathematically, we call this the **union** of two sets.\n\n## Summarizing Data\n\n- The remainder of today's lecture will be devoted to finding *numerical* summaries of a dataset $X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$.\n\n- This will lead us to several different **summary statistics**, which are mathematical quantities that seek to describe different aspects of our data. \n\n\n# Measures of Central Tendency\n\n## Quantifying \"Center\" {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- Here is a very broad question: what is the *center* of a dataset $X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$?\n\n- Perhaps the scores dataset from earlier is a bit too complicated- let's simplify things and look at the dataset\n$$ X = \\{1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6\\} $$\n\n- As a starting point, I can \"plot\" these points on a number line (to produce what is known as a **dotplot**):\n\n:::{.fragment}\n![](data.svg){width=65% fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Quantifying \"Center\" {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- Back to our question: what is the *center* of this dataset?\n:::\n\n- Perhaps we can think of *center* as a *balancing point*. In other words: where should I place a fulcrum to ensure this number line remains balanced?\n\n:::{.fragment}\n![](mean.svg){width=65% fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n- We call this balancing point the **arithmetic mean** (or just **mean**, or **average**, for short), and denote it $\\overline{x}$.\n\n---\n\n:::{nonincremental}\n- This notion of a \"balancing point\" applies to any set of numbers! For example, the dotplot of the exam scores dataset from before looks like:\n:::\n\n:::{.fragment}\n![](scores.svg){width=85% fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n---\n\n\n## The Mean {style=\"font-size: 28px\"}\n\n::: callout-note\n## **Formula:** The Mean\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 28px\"}\nGiven a set of data $x = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, we compute its **mean**, denoted $\\overline{x}$, using the formula\n$$ \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n} (x_1 + \\cdots + x_n) $$\nwhich can be equivalently written as\n$$ \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$\n:::\n:::\n\n- In words: we compute the mean by adding up all of the points included in our dataset, and dividing by the total number of points.\n\n## A Note on Notation\n\n- Perhaps you haven't seen the notation $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ before. Don't get scared by it! It's just a shorthand notation for the sum of the points $\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}$. \n\n- So, if it's easier for you, you can always think of $(x_1 + \\cdots x_n)$ in place of $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$.\n\n- Having said that, I will often use this notation (called **sigma notation**, as the symbol $\\sum$ is the capital Greek letter \"sigma\") as it saves quite a bit of time in the long run.\n\n    - I also urge you to familiarze yourself with $\\Sigma$ notation, as I'm sure you will encounter it even beyond this course!\n\n## Time for an Exercise!\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 1\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nCompute the mean of the set $B = \\{-1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4\\}$. Discuss with your neighbors!\n:::\n:::\n\n## Another One!\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 2\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nA collection of $n = 42$ exam scores have an average 50%. Two additional scores of 100% are reported. How does the average of scores change with the addition of these two new scores?\n:::\n:::\n\n# Measures of Spread\n\n## Range\n\n- Another way we can summarize a dataset $X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is to describe how *spread out* it is. \n\n-  One idea on how we can capture the spread is to say: how far apart is the *smallest* value from the *largest* value? \n\n- Indeed, this statistic has a name: the **range**.\n\n:::{.fragment}\n::: callout-note\n## **Formula:** Range\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 28px\"}\nGiven a set of numbers $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}$, we compute the **range** of $X$ as: $$ \\mathrm{range}(X) = \\max\\{x_1, \\cdots, x_n\\} - \\min\\{x_1, \\ \\cdots, \\ x_n\\} $$ i.e. the largest value minus the smallest value.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Leadup\n\n\n- Now, there is another way to think about spread: suppose we look at the average distance of points from their mean.\n\n- More specifically: define $d_i := x_i - \\overline{x}$ to be the **deviation** of the $i$^th^ point from the mean:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n![](sd.svg){width=65% fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n---\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- The distance between $x_i$ and $\\overline{x}$ is thus the squared deviance $d_i^2$.\n:::\n\n- Therefore, the average distance of each point from the mean would be\n$$ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2 $$\n\n- For reasons that are slightly beyond the scope of this course, we will actually divide by $n - 1$ as opposed to $n$. (It turns out that this yields a measure that has some slightly nicer properties than the one containing $1/n$ in place of $1/(n - 1)$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2 $$\n\n## The Variance\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- This is what we call the **variance** of the set $X$, denoted by $s_x^2$. \n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## **Formula:** Variance, and Standard Deviation\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 28px\"}\nGiven a set of data $X = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, we compute the **variance** of $X$ by\n$$ s_x^2 = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2 $$\nWe define the **standard deviation**, denoted by $s_x$, to be $\\sqrt{s_X^2}$; i.e.\n$$ s_x := \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2} $$\n:::\n:::\n\n## Time for an Exercise!\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 3\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nFor the set $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, compute $s_x$. Discuss with your neighbor!\n:::\n:::\n\n## IQR\n\n- There is yet another way to quantify the spread of a dataset, and that is what is known as the **Interquartile Range** (IQR, for short). \n\n:::{.fragment}\n::: callout-note\n## **Formula:** The IQR\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 28px\"}\nGiven a set of data $x = \\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, we compute its **interquartile range** using the formula\n$$ \\mathrm{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 $$\nwhere $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ denote the first and third quartiles, respectively.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n- In other words, the IQR is just the width of the box in a boxplot!\n\n## Five Number Summary\n\n- Speaking of boxplots, there is a set of numbers that occurs frequently when summarizing numerical data, collectively called the **five number summary**. The elements of the five number summary are:\n\n    1) The minimum\n    2) The first quartile\n    3) The median\n    4) The third quartile\n    5) The maximum\n\n## Time for an Exercise!\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 4\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nConsider a dataset $X$ that has boxplot given by:\n\n```{r, fig.height = 3}\nset.seed(123)\nx <- rnorm(100, 6)\ndata.frame(x) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n  stat_boxplot(geom = \"errorbar\", \n               width = 0.25,\n               linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill =  \"#7f9ab5\", \n               size = 1,\n               outlier.size = 4) +\n  theme_economist(base_size = 18) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(\"#f0ebd8\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0ebd8\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16,\n                                    margin = margin(\n                                      t = 0, \n                                      r = 10,\n                                      b = 0, \n                                      l = 0)),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  ylim(c(-0.75, 0.75)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Boxplot of X\")\n```\n\nProvide the five number summary, along with the IQR.
