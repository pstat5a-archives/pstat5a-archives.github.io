Another way we could have kept track of the outcomes was by using a table, recording the outcome of the first die roll in the rows and the outcomes of the second in the columns:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n    \t<td></td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:center\">1</td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:center\">2</td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:center\">3</td>\n        <td style=\"text-align:center\">4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    \t<td>1</td>\n        <td>(1, 1)</td>\n        <td>(1, 2)</td>\n        <td>(1, 3)</td>\n        <td>(1, 4)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    \t<td>2</td>\n        <td>(2, 1)</td>\n        <td>(2, 2)</td>\n        <td>(2, 3)</td>\n        <td>(2, 4)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    \t<td>3</td>\n        <td>(3, 1)</td>\n        <td>(3, 2)</td>\n        <td>(3, 3)</td>\n        <td>(3, 4)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    \t<td>4</td>\n        <td>(4, 1)</td>\n        <td>(4, 2)</td>\n        <td>(4, 3)</td>\n        <td>(4, 4)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n:::\n\n## Other Ways of Describing Outcome Spaces {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- So, tables are a good way of keeping track of outcomes.\n\n- But, they really only work when we have *two* of something (e.g. *two* dice, *two* coins, etc.).

I could ask myself: in how many outcomes does the second die roll result in a higher number than the first?\n\n- This leads us to the notion of an **event**.\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.callout-note}\n## **Definition**\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nAn **event** is a subset of the outcome space. In other words, an event is just a set consisting of one or more outcomes.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n---\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- As an example, the event $E$ defined to be \"the second dice lands on a number strictly larger than the first\" can be written\n$$ E = \\{(1, 2), \\ (1, 3), \\ (1, 4), \\ (2, 3), \\ (2, 4), \\ (3, 4)\\} $$\nas these are the only outcomes in which the second dice lands on a number strictly larger than the first.\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 2\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nConsider the experiment of tossing three coins and recording the faces that appear. If $F$ denotes the event \"an even number of heads was observed\", what is the mathematical representation of $F$ (i.e. as a collection of outcomes)?\n:::\n:::\n\n## Unions and Intersections\n\n- Remember how we talked about the *union* of two sets last week? \n- Well, since events are just sets, we can talk about the union of two sets. \n\n    - In words, the union corresponds to an \"or\" statement.\n    \n    - For example, let $E$ denote the event \"it is raining\" and $F$ denote the event \"the ground is wet\", then the event $E \\cup F$ would be the event \"it is raining or the ground is wet\".\n\n- The **intersection** of two events (denoted with the $\\cap$ symbol), corresponds to an \"and\" statement\n\n    - For example, if $E$ and $F$ are defined as in the bullet point above, then $E \\cap F$ denotes the event \"it is raining and the ground is wet\".\n\n## Complements\n\n- The **complement** of an event $E$, denoted $E^{\\complement}$, represents the event \"not $E$\"\n\n    - For instance, if $E$ again denotes the event \"it is raining\", then $E^{\\complement}$ denotes the event \"it is not raining\".\n\n## Leadup\n\n- Recall that $E \\cap F$ denotes the event \"both $E$ and $F$ occurred.\"\n\n- Also recall that $A^{\\complement}$ denotes \"not $A$\"; i.e. \"$A$ did not occur\"\n\n- As such, $(E \\cap F)^{\\complement}$ denotes the event \"it is not the case that both $E$ or $F$ occurred.\"\n\n    - This means that either $E$ did not occur, or $F$ did not occur (or both).\n    \n    - Mathematically, this is equivalent to $E^\\complement \\cup F^\\complement$.\n\n- As such, it seems we have arrived at the following equality:\n$$ (E \\cap F)^{\\complement} = E^\\complement \\cup F^\\complement $$\n\n---\n\n## DeMorgan's Laws\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- This is one of what are known as **DeMorgan's Laws**.\n:::\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: callout-important\n## DeMorgan's Laws\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nGiven two events $E$ and $F$, we have the following:\n\n- $(E \\cap F)^{\\complement} = E^\\complement \\cup F^\\complement$\n- $(E \\cup F)^{\\complement} = E^\\complement \\cap F^\\complement$\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n- We will not prove these in this class. However, please familiarize yourself with them as they will be incredibly useful!\n\n---\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 3\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nConsider the experiment of tossing two coins at the same time. Define the following events:\n\n- $A$ = \"we observe an even number of heads\"\n- $B$ = \"we observe an odd number of heads\"\n- $C$ = \"both coins landed heads\"\n\nExpress the following events in words:\n\n- $(A \\cup C)^\\complement$\n- $A \\cap B$\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Leadup\n\n- Now, there is something interesting about the events defined in the previous example. \n\n- The outcome space of the underlying experiment is\n$$ \\Omega = \\{ (H, H), \\ (H, T), \\ (T, H), \\ (T, T)\\} $$\nand\n    - $A = \\{(H, H), \\ (T, T)\\}$\n    - $B = \\{(H, T), \\ (T, H)\\}$\n    - $C = \\{(H, H)\\}$\n\n\n---\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- First note that the event $C$ is contained in the event $A$.\n:::\n\n- This is an example of a **subset**: we say that a set $A$ is a *subset* of another set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are also elements of $B$. We use the notation $A \\subseteq B$.\n\n    - For example, $\\{2, 3\\} \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$\n\n- Another thing to note is that $A \\cap B$ has no elements- there is nothing common to both $A$ and $B$!\n\n    - The set with no elements is called the **empty set**, and is denoted $\\varnothing$.\n    \n    - Two events whose intersection is the empty said are said to be **disjoint**.\n\n\n## Probability\n\n- Now, you may note that we have yet to mention the term \"probability.\" \n\n- To get a better sense of \"probability\", let's examine how we use the word in everyday speech:\n\n    - \"the chance of rain is 50%\"\n    - \"odds of winning big at a Casino is 1%\"\n    - \"probability of scoring a 100% on the PSTAT 5A Midterm 1 is 95%\"\n\n- Notice that \"rain\", \"winning big at a Casino\", and \"scoring 100% on the PSTAT 5A Midterm 1\" are all events.\n\n- As such, \"probability\" seems to take in an event and spit out a number.\n\n## Probability\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- In other words, we can think of \"probability\" (or, more accurately, what we refer to as a **probability measure**) as a *function* that takes in an event and outputs a number.\n:::\n\n- The symbol we use for a probability measure is $\\mathbb{P}$; i.e. we write $\\mathbb{P}(E)$ to denote \"the probability of event $E$\".\n\n- Now, this doesn't really tell us how to define $\\mathbb{P}(E)$ for an arbitrary event $E$.\n\n- There are (roughly) two schools of thought when it comes to defining the probability of an event: the **long-run frequency** approach, and the **classical approach**.\n\n## Long-Run-Frequency Approach\n\n- The long-run frequency approach defines the probability of an event $E$ to be the proportion of times $E$ occurs, if the underlying experiment were to be repeated a large number of times.\n\n- To help us understand the notion of long-run frequencies, let's go through an example together. Suppose we toss a coin and record whether the outcome lands `heads` or `tails`, and further suppose we observe the following tosses:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{style=\"text-align:center\"}\n`H`, \\ `T`, \\  `T`, \\  `H`, \\  `T`, \\  `H`, \\  `H`, \\  `H`, \\  `T`, \\  `T`\n:::\n:::\n\n- To compute the relative frequency of `heads` after each toss, we count the number of times we observed `heads` and divide by the total number of tosses observed.\n\n---\n\n| Toss | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|:----:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| Outcome| `H` | `T` | `T` | `H` | `T` | `H` | `H` | `H` | `T` | `T` | \n| Raw freq. of `H` | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |\n| Rel. freq of `H` | 1/1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 2/4 | 2/5 | 3/6 | 4/7 | 5/8 | 5/9 | 5/10 |\n\n```{r, fig.height = 3.5}\n#| echo: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nx <- 1:10\ny <- c(1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/4, 2/5, 3/6, 4/7, 5/8, 5/9, 5/10)\n\ndata.frame(x = x, y = y) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_economist(base_size = 18) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(\"#f0ebd8\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0ebd8\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16,\n                                    margin = margin(\n                                      t = 0, \n                                      r = 10,\n                                      b = 0, \n                                      l = 0)),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16)\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Relative Frequencies of Heads\")\n```\n\n---\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- It turns out (by what is known as the **Weak Law of Large Numbers**) that, regardless of the experiment and event, the relative frequencies will converge to some fixed value.\n:::\n\n- What the long-run frequencies approach to probability says is to define this value to be the probability of the event.\n\n:::{.fragment}\n```{r, fig.height = 3.5}\n#| echo: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nset.seed(5)\n\nx <- 1:200\ny <- cumsum(sample(c(0, 1), size = 200, replace = T))/x\n\ndata.frame(x = x, y = y) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_economist(base_size = 18) +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(\"#f0ebd8\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0ebd8\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16,\n                                    margin = margin(\n                                      t = 0, \n                                      r = 10,\n                                      b = 0, \n                                      l = 0)),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16)\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Relative Frequencies of Heads\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Classical Approach {style=\"font-size:28px\"}\n\n- The second way to define probabilities is what is known as the **classical approach**.\n\n- As an important note: we can only apply the classical approach if we believe all outcomes in our experiment to be **equally likely**.\n\n    - Examples of situations in which it is safe to assume equally likely outcomes include: tossing a *fair* coin some number of times, rolling a *fair* $k$-sided die, selecting a card *at random* from a deck of cards, etc.\n\n- If we make the equally likely outcomes assumption, then the classical approach to probability tells us to define $\\mathbb{P}(E)$ as \n$$ \\mathbb{P}(E) = \\frac{\\text{number of ways $E$ can occur}}{\\text{total number of outcomes}} $$\n\n- So, for example, if we toss a fair coin once, then the classical approach to probability (which can be used since the coin is *fair*) states that\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\texttt{heads}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n## Comparisons\n\n- Let's quickly compare these two approaches to defining the probability of an event.\n\n- The long-run frequencies definition has the benefit of not requiring the assumption of equally likely outcomes.\n\n    - However, it relies on the (perhaps odd) consideration of considering what happens when we repeat an experiment *a large number of times*.\n    \n- The classical approach does not rely on such considerations, making the definitions it produces perhaps a bit more easily interpretable.\n\n    - However, it crucially requires the assumption of equally likely outcomes.\n    \n## Comparisons\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- For the purposes of this class, we won't be too concerned with defining the probability of an event: in many cases, we will just give you the probability.\n:::\n\n- In situations where we do *not* provide a probability *a priori*, there will likely be some key word or phrase that lets you know we are looking for the classical definition.\n\n    - Again, important words/phrases to look out for are: *fair*, *at random*, etc.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 4\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 24px\"}\n**Part (a)** Consider the experiment of rolling a fair six-sided die once and recording the number on the face that is showing.

Axioms are like the building blocks, or base assumptions on which a system of math is predicated.\n    \n# Probability Rules\n\n## Summary\n\n- Let's quickly summarize the concepts/terms we've covered:\n\n    - Experiment: any procedure that can be repeated an infinite number of times, where each time the procedure is repeated there are a fixed set of outcomes that can occur.\n    - Outcome Space: the set of all outcomes associated with a particular experiment.\n    - Event: a subset of the outcome space\n    - Probability (measure): a function that takes an event and outputs a number\n\n- These are the basic building blocks of probability.\n\n- We will now combine them!\n\n## Notational Reminder\n\n- Before we go any further, I'd like to stress something:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: callout-important\n## Important\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nIn this class, using proper notation is very important.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n- For example, if we have an event $E$ whose probability of occurring is, say, $0.5$, we must write $\\mathbb{P}(E) = 0.5$; it is **NOT** correct to say $E = 0.5$, or $\\mathbb{P} = 0.5$.\n\n\n## The Complement Rule\n\n- The first result we will explore is the so-called **complement rule**.\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: callout-important\n## The Complement Rule\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nGiven an event $E$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(E^\\complement) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(E)$\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n- As an example: if we roll a fair six-sided die and if $E =$ \"rolling a $1$\", then $E^\\complement =$ \"not rolling a $1$\" and $$\\mathbb{P}(E^\\complement) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(E) = 1 - 1/6 = \\boxed{5/6}$$\n\n## The Probability of the Empty Set\n\n- Recall that the empty set ($\\varnothing$) is the set containing no elements.\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: callout-important\n## The Probability of the Empty Set\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\varnothing) = 0$.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n- The \"proof\" of this is relatively simple: note that $\\Omega^\\complement = \\varnothing$ (the opposite of \"everything\" is \"nothing\"); we also know that $\\mathbb{P}(\\Omega) = 1$ so\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\Omega^\\complement) = \\mathbb{P}(\\varnothing) = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\n\n## The Addition Rule\n\n- The next result we will explore is the so-called **addition rule**.\n\n:::{.fragment}\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: callout-important\n## The Addition Rule\n\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nGiven events $E$ and $F$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(E \\cup F) = \\mathbb{P}(E) + \\mathbb{P}(F) - \\mathbb{P}(E \\cap F)$\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n- Note that if $E$ and $F$ are disjoint, then we recover the third axiom of probability!\n\n## Worked-Out Example\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Worked-Out Example 2\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nA recent survey at the *Isla Vista Co-Op* revealed that 50% of shoppers buy bread, 30% buy jam, and 20% buy both bread and jam.\n\na) What is the probability that a randomly selected shopper will **not** purchase jam?\nb) What is the probability that a randomly selected shopper will purchase either bread or jam (or both)?\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Solution to Part (a)\n\n- Let $J$ denote the event \"a randomly selected shopper *will* purchase jam\".\n\n    - From the problem statement, we have that $\\mathbb{P}(J) = 0.3$\n\n- The event \"a randomly selected shopper will not purchase jam\" is given by $J^\\complement$, meaning the quantity we seek is $\\mathbb{P}(J^\\complement)$.\n\n- By the **Complement Rule**, we have\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(J^\\complement) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(J) = 1 - 0.3 = \\boxed{0.7 = 70\\%} $$\n\n## Solution to Part (b) {style=\"font-size:32px\"}\n\n- Let $J$ be defined as before, and let $B$ denote the event \"a randomly selected shopper will purchase bread or jam\"\n\n    -
