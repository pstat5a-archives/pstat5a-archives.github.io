As such, you don't need to label your tasks; we will only be looking at your final product (i.e. your final PDF).\n\n\n## Introduction to Markdown Syntax\n\nRemember way back in Week 1, when we started adding \"Markdown Cells\" to our Jupyter Notebooks? Unbeknownst to you, you've actually been using a *different* computing language than Python! [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) defines **Markdown** as:\n\n> [...] a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.\n\nWhat this means is that Markdown is a language that is specifically designed to communicate with your computer and facilitate the formatting of text and equations.\n\n## Markdown Syntax\n\nAs with Python, Markdown has some specific syntax as well. We will take a few moments to explore some of this syntax.\n\n### 1. Headers\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Important Information\n\nThere are several different \"levels\" of headers:\n\n- A main (first-level) header\n- A second-level  header\n- A third-level header\n- And so on and so forth\n\nIn Markdown, the level of the header is specified by how many hashtags (`#`'s) we include before the header text.\n\n:::\n\nFor example: all of the headers used in this explanation document are either second- or third-level headers.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd a first-level (main) header right after the `setup` code chunk, and have it say `Section 1: Markdown Syntax`. Run this cell, and ensure it displays properly. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAfter your first-level (main) `Section 1: Markdown Syntax` header, add a second-level header that says `Subsection 1.1`. Again, run this cell and ensure that this header appears smaller than the first-level (main) header you created in the action item above.\n\n:::\n\n\n### 2. Text Formatting\n\nAs we have previously seen, text written in a Markdown cell will display exactly as it is written in your final PDF. We can, however, also spice up the formatting of our text!\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note\nThere are several different text formatting options available to us in Markdown:\n\n- **Boldface Text**: `**Boldface Text**`\n- _Italicized Text_: `_Italicized Text_` or `*Italicized Text*`\n- `Fixed-Width Text`: ``` `Fixed-Width Text` ```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nUnderneath your second-level header `\"Subsection 1.1\"`, write the following sentence **including all formatting as it appears here**: \n\n> The **quick** brown fox *jumps* over the `lazy` dog\n\n:::\n\nBy the way, notice how we managed to display the sentence above as a block-quote? The syntax to do that in Markdown is using a single `>` symbol, followed by a space. For example,\n\n> This text\n\nwas generated using the code `> This text`. \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n## Caution\n\nBe mindful about line breaks and spaces when using Markdown syntax.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nUnderneath your \"quick brown fox\" text, add a block-quote that says\n\n> That was a really cool sentence!\n\nRun your Markdown cell, and ensure the block-quote is displaying properly. (Again: line breaks and indentation will be important!)\n\n:::\n\n### 3. Itemized and Enumerated Lists\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Important Information\n\nThere are two main types of lists: **itemized** and **enumerated** lists. Itemized lists have no explicit ordering: these are sometimes called \"bulleted\" lists, and look like this:\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\nEnumerated lists *do* have an explicit ordering:\n\n1) Item 1\n2) Item 2\n3) Item 3\n\nIn Markdown, itemized lists are created by navigating to a new line, writing a dash (`-`) or an asterisk (`*`), followed by a space, followed by the text you wish to have displayed in the corresponding item. For instance: the itemized list above was generated using the code\n\n```{r, eval = F}\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n```\n\nIn Markdown, enumerated lists are created by navigating to a new line, writing the number of the item (e.g. 1, 2, etc.) either either a close-parenthesis (`)`), or a period (`.`) For instance: both of the following codes will generate an enumerated list:\n\n\n```{r, eval = F}\n1) Item 1\n2) Item 2\n3) Item 3\n```\n\n```{r, eval = F}\n1. Item 1\n2. Item 2\n3. Item 3\n```\n\nTo add sublevel items, navitage to a new line, hit the space bar 4 times, and then add the corresponding item symbol (i.e. `-` or `*` for itemized lists; `1)` or `a)` or `1.` or `a.` for enumerated lists; etc.)\n\n- As an example, this is a main-level item\n    - Followed by a sublevel item!\n\nThis was generated using\n\n```{r, eval = F}\n- As an example, this is a main-level item\n    - Followed by a sublevel item!\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd a new second-level header to your document that says `Subsection 1.2: Itemized and Enumerated Lists`. Underneath this, include the following list (making sure it displays properly when you run the cell!)\n\n- It is very important to check the Binomial Conditions before using the Binomial Distribution!\n    - Failure to check the necessary conditions can lead to incorrect results.\n    - Incorrect results are not good!\n\n:::\n\n\n### 4. Equations in Markdown\n\nOne of the very nice things about Markdown is that it is able to (very nicely) combine both plain-text as well as equations! \\\n\nThe language used to specify equations in Markdown is called `LaTeX` (pronounced \"lay-TECH\", or \"lah-TECH\"). LaTeX equations have two main styles: inline, like $x + y$, and \"display-style\", like\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i $$\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Important Information\n\nIn LaTeX, inline equations are specified by single dollar signs and display-style equations are specified by double-dollar signs. For instance:\n\n- `$x + y$` will display as $x + y$\n- `$$x + y$$` will display as $$x + y$$\n\n:::\n\n\nInside either an inline or display-style equation environment, we can use LaTeX-specific syntax to generate equations. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Important Information\n\n- Standard mathematical symbols display in LaTeX as they would in text: this includes addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), division (`/`), and multiplication (`*`).\n- The symbol for \"less than or equal to\" (≤) is typeset as `\\leq`; the symbol for \"greater than or equal to\" (≥) is typeset as `\\geq`.\n- Exponents are generated using the caret (`^`): for example, `$x^2$` displays as $x^2$\n- Subscripts are generated using the underscore (`_`): for example, `$x_2$` displays as $x_2$\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd a second-level (main)  header that says `\"Subsection 1.3: Typesetting Equations\"`, and underneath it write the following sentence (including all LaTeX formatting!):\n\n> The Pythagorean Theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.\n\nRun this cell, and ensure it displays properly.\n\n:::\n\nWe can also typeset more advanced formulas and symbols:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Important Information\n\n- Sums (using sigma-notation) are generated using the `\\sum` command: for example, `$\\sum_{x = 0}^{1} x$` displays as $\\sum_{x = 0}^{1} x$\n\n- Integrals are generated using the `\\int` command: for example, `$\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\ dx$` displays as $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\ dx$\n\n- Fractions are generated using the `\\frac` command: for example, `$\\frac{1}{2}$` displays as $\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n- Square-roots are generated using the `\\sqrt` command: for example, `$\\sqrt{2}$` displays as $\\sqrt{2}$\n\n- The symbol $\\pi$ is generated using `$\\pi$`\n\n- Adding a bar on top of a variable can be done using `\\overline{}`; e.g. `$\\overline{y}$` typesets as $\\overline{y}$\n\n- The probability symbol can be typeset using `$\\mathbb{P}$`; e.g. $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\n- The symbol for Expected Value can be typeset using `$\\mathbb{E}$`; e.g. $\\mathbb{E}$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n## Note\n\nIn LaTeX, curly braces (`{`, `}`) are used to delineate \"chunks\" of code/text. For example, if you just write `$x^-2$`, this displays as $x^-2$. If we want to display $x^{-2}$, we need to use `$x^{-2}$`.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n## Note\n\nWhen writing fractions inside parentheses, it is important to use `\\left(` and `\\right)` to ensure the size of the parentheses scale with the fractions. For example,\n$$ (\\frac{1}{2}) $$\nwhich was generated using `$$ (\\frac{1}{2}) $$`, looks a bit worse than\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nwhich was generated using `$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$`.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd the following equation to your document:\n$$ f_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2}  $$\n\n:::\n\n\nThere is nothing stopping us from including equations in itemized and enumerated lists! \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd the following list to your document, ensuring that it displays properly when the cell is run (pay attention to the formatting of the text as well!):\n\n- **Pythagorean Theorem:** $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\n- **Euler's Identity:** $e^{i \\pi} + 1 = 0$\n\n:::\n\nIt may also be useful to learn how to make piecewise-defined equations using LaTeX. To typeset piecewise-defined functions, we use the `cases` environment:\n$$ \\begin{cases} \n    a   & \\text{if condition 1}   \\\\\n    b   & \\text{if condition 2}   \\\\\n    c   & \\text{if condition 3}   \\\\\n\\end{cases} $$\nwas generated using the code\n```\n$$ \\begin{cases} \n    a   & \\text{if condition 1}   \\\\\n    b   & \\text{if condition 2}   \\\\\n    c   & \\text{if condition 3}   \\\\\n\\end{cases} $$\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd the probability density function $f_X(x)$ of the $\\mathrm{Unif}(a, \\ b)$ distribution to your Notebook:\n$$ f_X(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b - a} & \\text{if } a \\leq x \\leq b \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$\n\n:::\n\nFinally, we should talk about how to align equations. The easiest way to align display-style equations is using an `align*` environment. For example:\n\\begin{align*}\n  a + b       & = c + d + e   \\\\\n  a + b + 0   & = c + d\n\\end{align*}\nwas typeset using\n```\n\\begin{align*}\n  a + b       & = c + d + e   \\\\\n  a + b + 0   & = c + d + 0\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nAdd the following set of equations into your Markdown document, taking care to use appropriate alignment.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\overline{x}            & = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i    \\\\\n  n \\overline{x}    & = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\nThis is only just the surface of what LaTeX can do! If you are planning on going into any STEM-related field, we highly encourage you to delve deeper into the world of LaTeX as it will be a very valuable skill to have.\n\n\n### Hyperlinks\n\nSometimes it will be necessary to include hyperlinks into our reports. With Markdown, this is fairly straightforward!\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n## Important Information\n\nThe syntax of including a hyperlink in a Markdown cell is as follows:\n\n> `[text](link)`\n\nFor example, [Click Here](https://google.com) was generated using `[Click Here](https://google.com)`.\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n\n## Action Item\n\nMake a new second-level header in your document called `Section 1.4: Hyperlinks`. Underneath this header, create clickable text that says \"`PSTAT Department Website`\" and, when clicked, navigates the user to the main website of the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability here at UCSB (https://pstat.ucsb.edu). Your final result should look and function like [PSTAT Department Website](https://pstat.ucsb.edu).\n\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css","styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"lab08.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"sandstone","title":"Lab08","subtitle":"Markdown Syntax","author":[{"name":"PSTAT 5A, with Ethan Marzban","affiliations":[{"name":"Spring 2023"}]}],"author-title":"Course","affiliation-title":"Quarter","title-block-banner":"#4144a6"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
