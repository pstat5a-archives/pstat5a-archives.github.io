Rather, they want people that are not only well-versed in the programmatic applications of data but also the reasons behind *why* they are applying the programming tools they are applying!\n\n## The Path Forward\n\n- So, how does this course factor into things?\n\n- From the course description:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n> Introduction to data science. Concepts of statistical thinking. Topics include random variables, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression. Visualizing, analyzing and interpreting real world data using Python. Computing labs required.\n:::\n\n- So this course is designed to be an introduction to data science.\n\n---\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n- We will start with **Descriptive Statistics**, a branch of statistics designed to try and *describe* or *summarize* data.\n:::\n\n- We will then devote some time to talking about **Probability**, which is in many ways the theory behind randomness and uncertainty.\n\n- Next, we will use **Inferential Statistics** to discuss how we can use data to draw conclusions (i.e. *inferences*) about the world around us.\n\n    - This will include both **Confidence Intervals** as well as **Hypothesis Testing**.\n\n- Finally, we will discuss a topic known as **Regression** which will be our first (and only, for this class) foray into statistical modeling.\n\n# So, without further ado....
