As such, it is tempting to adopt\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} $$ \nas, under certain conditions, this follows a standard normal distribution under the null (i.e. when assuming the true population mean $\\mu$ is in fact $\\mu_0$):\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, \\ 1) $$ \n\n\n## Testing a Mean\n\n- But, we won't always have access to the true population standard deviation $\\sigma$! Rather, sometimes we only have access to $s_X$, the sample standard deviation. \n\n- This leads to the following test statistic:\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{s_X / \\sqrt{n}} $$ \nwhich now no longer follows the standard normal distribution under the null, but rather a **_t_-distribution** with $n - 1$ **degrees of freedom**:\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} = \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{s_X / \\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n - 1} $$ \n\n    \n## Sampling Distribution of $\\overline{X}$\n\n:::{.fragment}\n```{mermaid}\ngraph TB\n  A[Is the population Normal?  . ] --> |Yes| B{{Use Normal .}}\n  A --> |No| C[Is n >= 30?  .]\n  C --> |Yes| D[sigma or s?  .]\n  C --> |No| E{{cannot proceed   .}}\n  D --> |sigma| F{{Use Normal .}}\n  D --> |s| G{{Use t }}\n```\n:::\n\n## Test Statistic\n\n- So, to summarize, our test statistic is:\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} = \\begin{cases}\n  \\displaystyle \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}    & \\text{if } \\quad  \\begin{array}{rl} \\bullet & \\text{pop. is normal, OR} \\\\ \\bullet & \\text{$n \\geq 30$ AND $\\sigma$ is known} \\end{array} \\quad \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, \\ 1) \\\\[5mm]\n  \\displaystyle \\frac{\\overline{X} - \\mu_0}{s / \\sqrt{n}}         & \\text{if } \\quad  \\begin{array}{rl} \\bullet & \\text{$n \\geq 30$ AND $\\sigma$ is not known} \\end{array} \\quad \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{n - 1}\n\\end{cases} $$\n\n## Test\n\n- Recall our null and alternative hypotheses:\n$$ \\left[ \\begin{array}{rr}\n  H_0:    & \\mu = \\mu_0   \\\\\n  H_A:    & \\mu \\neq \\mu_0\n\\end{array} \\right. $$\n\n- If an observed instance of $\\overline{X}$ is much larger than $\\mu_0$, we are more inclined to believe the alternative over the null.\n\n    - In other words, we would reject $H_0$ for large positive values of $\\mathrm{TS}$.\n    \n- However, we would *also* be more inclined to believe the alternative over the null if an observed instance of $\\overline{X}$ was much *smaller* than $\\mu_0$.\n\n    - In other words, we would reject $H_0$ for large negative values of $\\mathrm{TS}$ as well.\n    \n    \n\n## Test\n\n- We combine these two cases using absolute values:\n$$ \\texttt{decision}(\\mathrm{TS}) = \\begin{cases} \\texttt{reject } H_0 & \\text{if } |\\mathrm{TS}| > c \\\\ \\texttt{fail to reject } H_0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\ \\end{cases}  $$\nfor some **critical value** $c$.\n\n    - The critical value will depend not only on the **confidence level**, but also the **sampling distribution** of $\\overline{X}$.\n    \n    - Specifically, as we have previously seen, it will be the appropriate **percentile** (\"appropriate\" as dictated by the confidence level) of either the $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\ 1)$ distribution or the $t_{n - 1}$ distribution.\n    \n## Critical Value\n\n```{r, fig = T}\n#| echo: False\n\nx <- seq(-3, 3, by = 0.1)\ndata.frame(x) %>% ggplot(aes(x = x)) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm,\n                args = list(0, 1),\n                xlim = c(-3, -1.45),\n                geom = \"area\",\n                fill = \"#a4caeb\") +stat_function(fun = dnorm,\n                args = list(0, 1),\n                xlim = c(1.45, 3),\n                geom = \"area\",\n                fill = \"#a4caeb\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm,\n                args = list(0, 1),\n                linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(\n      x = -1.45,\n      xend = -1.45,\n      y = 0,\n      yend = dnorm(-1.45)\n    )) +\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(\n      x = 1.45,\n      xend = 1.45,\n      y = 0,\n      yend = dnorm(1.45)\n    )) +\n  theme_economist_white() +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(\"#f0ebd8\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0ebd8\")\n  ) +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"\") \n```\n\n- The critical value is the *positive* value along the _x_-axis that makes the blue shaded region equal to $\\alpha$.\n\n## _p_-Values\n\n- We also saw how, instead of looking at critical values, we can also look at _p_-values.\n\n- The _p_-value is the probability of observing something as or more extreme (in the directino of the alternative) than what we currently observe.\n\n- As such, _p_-values that are smaller than the level of significance lead credence to the alternative over the null;

Rather, we will only have access to the *sample* variances $s_X^2$ and $s_Y^2$. Hence, we modify our test statistic to be of the form\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} = \\frac{\\overline{Y} - \\overline{X}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_X^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_Y^2}{n_2}}} $$ \n\n## Distribution of the Test Statistic {style=\"font-size:32px\"}\n\n- This statistic is no longer normally distributed under the null.\n\n- It *approximately* follows a _t_ distribution with degrees of freedom given by the Satterthwaite Approximation:\n$$ \\mathrm{df} = \\mathrm{round}\\left\\{ \\frac{ \\left[ \\left( \\frac{s_X^2}{n_1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{s_Y^2}{n_2} \\right) \\right]^2 }{ \\frac{\\left( \\frac{s_X^2}{n_1} \\right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{s_Y^2}{n_2} \\right)^2}{n_2 - 1} } \\right\\} $$\n\n- That is;\n$$ \\mathrm{TS} \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} t_{\\mathrm{df}}; \\quad \\text{df given by above}$$\n\n## Test {style=\"font-size:32px\"}\n\n- If we are conducting a two-sided hypothesis test, then both large *positive* values *and* large *negative* values of our test statistic would lead credence to the null over the alternative. \n\n    - As such, our test would reject for large values of $|\\mathrm{TS}|$\n    \n- If instead our alternative took the form $\\mu_1 < \\mu_2$; i.e. that $\\delta = \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 > 0$, our test would reject for large positive values of $\\mathrm{TS}$.\n\n- If instead our alternative took the form $\\mu_1 > \\mu_2$; i.e. that $\\delta = \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 < 0$, our test would reject for large negative values of $\\mathrm{TS}$.\n\n- Again, the key is to note that after reparameterizing the problem to be in terms of the difference $\\delta = \\mu_2 - \\mu_1$, the problem becomes a familiar one-parameter problem.\n\n\n\n## Worked-Out Example {style=\"font-size:26px\"}\n:::{.fragment}\n::: callout-tip\n## Worked-Out Example 2\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: {style=\"font-size: 22px\"}\nA renter wants to know which city is cheaper to live in: *GauchoVille* or *Bruin City*.
