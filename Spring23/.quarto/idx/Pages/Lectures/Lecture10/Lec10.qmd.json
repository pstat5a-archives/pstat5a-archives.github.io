To that end, she takes a representative sample of 100 cats and finds that 3.2\\% of cats in this sample have FIV.\n\na. Identify the population.\nb. Identify the sample.\nc.

Is the value of $3.2\\%$ a population parameter, or an observed instance of a sample statistic?\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Solution {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\na. the population is the corpus of all cats in the world, since we the veterinarian seeks to describe the prevalence of FIV among *all cats*.\n\nb. In this context, the sample is the set of 100 cats the veterinarian examined.\n\nc. The population parameter of interest is $p =$ \"the true proportion of cats that suffer from FIV\".\n\nd. The value of 3.2\\% is a **sample statistic**, because if the veterinarian had taken a *different* sample of 100 cats she likely would have observed a different proportion of FIV-positive cats.\n\n\n## Your Turn!\n:::{.fragment}\n::: callout-tip\n## Exercise 1\n\n:::{.nonincremental}\n::: {style=\"font-size: 30px\"}\nA group of (slightly bored) college students would like to determine the true average amount of soda (in liters) in 1-liter soda bottles. To that effect, they purchas 12 different 1-liter soda bottles and find the average amount of soda in these 12 bottles is 0.98L.\n\na. Identify the population.\nb. Identify the sample.\nc. Identify the population parameter of interest.\nd. Is the value of 0.98 a population parameter, or an observed instance of a sample statistic?\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Different Population Parameters {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- So far we've seen examples of two different population parameters:\n    - A **population proportion**\n    - A **population mean**\n- Other population parameters exist! For instance, we could talk about the population *median*, the population *variance*, or even the population *IQR*.\n\n- Up until now, I've been pretty vague about what \"inferences\" mean. This is because \"making inferences\" is a broad term!\n- One part of making inferences is trying to **estimate** the value of a population parameter.\n    - This process is called **parameter estimation**.\n\n## Parameter Estimation {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- Both Worked-Out Example 1 and Exercise 1 were (implicitly) problems about parmaeter estimation.\n    - In Worked-Out Example 1, the veterinarian wanted to *estimate* the true proportion of FIV-positive cats\n    - In Exercise 1, the college students wanted to *estimate* the true average amount of soda in 1L soda bottles.\n- In general, we use a sample statistic to estimate a population parameter. Some common estimators of some population parameters are:\n\n---\n\n:::{style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n| Parameter | Symbol | Estimator |\n|:---------:|:------:|:---------:|\n| Mean | $\\mu$ | $\\displaystyle \\overline{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}$ <br /> (the sample mean) |\n| Proportion | $p$ | $\\widehat{p}$ <br /> (the sample proportion) |\n| Variance | $\\sigma^2$ | $\\displaystyle s_x^2 = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2$ <br /> (the sample variance) |\n| Std.
