# Recap of Hypothesis Testing

## Setup

- Consider a population, governed by some parameter $\theta$ (e.g. a mean $\mu$, a variance $\sigma^2$, a proportion $p$, etc.)

- Suppose we have a **null hypothesis** that $\theta = \theta_0$ (for some specified and fixed value $\theta_0$), along with an **alternative hypothesis**.

- The goal of **hypothesis testing** is to use data (in the form of a representative sample taken from the population), and determine whether or not this data leads credence to the null in favor of the alternative.

    - Recall that there are four main types of alternatives we could adopt: **two-sided**, **lower-tailed**, **upper-tailed**, and **simple-vs-simple**.
    
## Testing a Mean

- Before MT2, we discussed the framework of hypothesis testing a population *proportion* _p_.

- After MT2, we discussed how to perform hypothesis testing on a population *mean* $\mu$.

- Let's, for the moment, consider a two-sided test:
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rr}
  H_0:    & \mu = \mu_0   \\
  H_A:    & \mu \neq \mu_0
\end{array} \right. $$

- Since we know that $\overline{X}$, the sample mean, is a relatively good point estimator of a population mean $\mu$, we know that our test statistic should involve $\overline{X}$ in some way.


## Testing a Mean

- Specifically, we know that our test statistics are usually *standardized* versions of point estimators. As such, it is tempting to adopt
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} $$ 
as, under certain conditions, this follows a standard normal distribution under the null (i.e. when assuming the true population mean $\mu$ is in fact $\mu_0$):
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, \ 1) $$ 


## Testing a Mean

- But, we won't always have access to the true population standard deviation $\sigma$! Rather, sometimes we only have access to $s_X$, the sample standard deviation. 

- This leads to the following test statistic:
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{s_X / \sqrt{n}} $$ 
which now no longer follows the standard normal distribution under the null, but rather a **_t_-distribution** with $n - 1$ **degrees of freedom**:
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{s_X / \sqrt{n}} \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} t_{n - 1} $$ 

    
## Sampling Distribution of $\overline{X}$

:::

## Test Statistic

- So, to summarize, our test statistic is:
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}    & \text{if } \quad  \begin{array}{rl} \bullet & \text{pop. is normal, OR} \\ \bullet & \text{$n \geq 30$ AND $\sigma$ is known} \end{array} \quad \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, \ 1) \\[5mm]
  \displaystyle \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}         & \text{if } \quad  \begin{array}{rl} \bullet & \text{$n \geq 30$ AND $\sigma$ is not known} \end{array} \quad \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} t_{n - 1}
\end{cases} $$

## Test

- Recall our null and alternative hypotheses:
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rr}
  H_0:    & \mu = \mu_0   \\
  H_A:    & \mu \neq \mu_0
\end{array} \right. $$

- If an observed instance of $\overline{X}$ is much larger than $\mu_0$, we are more inclined to believe the alternative over the null.

    - In other words, we would reject $H_0$ for large positive values of $\mathrm{TS}$.
    
- However, we would *also* be more inclined to believe the alternative over the null if an observed instance of $\overline{X}$ was much *smaller* than $\mu_0$.

    - In other words, we would reject $H_0$ for large negative values of $\mathrm{TS}$ as well.
    
    

## Test

- We combine these two cases using absolute values:
$$ \texttt{decision}(\mathrm{TS}) = \begin{cases} \texttt{reject } H_0 & \text{if } |\mathrm{TS}| > c \\ \texttt{fail to reject } H_0 & \text{otherwise}\\ \end{cases}  $$
for some **critical value** $c$.

    - The critical value will depend not only on the **confidence level**, but also the **sampling distribution** of $\overline{X}$.
    
    - Specifically, as we have previously seen, it will be the appropriate **percentile** ("appropriate" as dictated by the confidence level) of either the $\mathcal{N}(0, \ 1)$ distribution or the $t_{n - 1}$ distribution.
    
## Critical Value

```{r, fig = T}
#| echo: False

x <- seq(-3, 3, by = 0.1)
data.frame(x) %>% ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(0, 1),
                xlim = c(-3, -1.45),
                geom = "area",
                fill = "#a4caeb") +stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(0, 1),
                xlim = c(1.45, 3),
                geom = "area",
                fill = "#a4caeb") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(0, 1),
                linewidth = 1) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      x = -1.45,
      xend = -1.45,
      y = 0,
      yend = dnorm(-1.45)
    )) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      x = 1.45,
      xend = 1.45,
      y = 0,
      yend = dnorm(1.45)
    )) +
  theme_economist_white() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect("#f0ebd8"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f0ebd8")
  ) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") 
```

- The critical value is the *positive* value along the _x_-axis that makes the blue shaded region equal to $\alpha$.

## _p_-Values

- We also saw how, instead of looking at critical values, we can also look at _p_-values.

- The _p_-value is the probability of observing something as or more extreme (in the directino of the alternative) than what we currently observe.

- As such, _p_-values that are smaller than the level of significance lead credence to the alternative over the null; i.e. we reject whenever $p < \alpha$.

    - Note this means that the way we compute _p_-values depends on the type of test (i.e. two-sided, lower-tailed, or upper-tailed) that we are conducting.

## Worked-Out Example 1

:::{.nonincremental}
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
A city official claims that the average monthly rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in *GauchoVille* is \$1.1k. To test this claim, a representative sample of 37 1 bedroom apartments is taken; the average monthly rent of these 37 apartments is found to be \$1.21k and the standard deviation of these 37 apartments is found to be 0.34. Assume we are conducting a two-sided test with a 5\% level of significance.

a. Define the parameter of interest.
b. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
c. Compute the value of the test statistic.
d. Assuming the null is correct, what is the distribution of the test statistic?
e. What is the critical value of the test?
f. Conduct the test, and phrase your conclusions in the context of the problem.
g. What code would we use to compute the _p_-value? Would we expect this value to be less than or greater than 5\%?

:::
:::
:::
:::

## Solutions

a. $\mu =$ average monthly cost of a 1 bedroom apartment in *GauchoVille*. \

b. $$\left[ \begin{array}{rr}
  H_0:    & \mu = 1.1   \\
  H_A:    & \mu \neq 1.1
\end{array} \right. $$ \

c. Since we do not have access to the population standard deviation, we use
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \frac{\overline{X} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.21 - 1.1}{0.34 / \sqrt{37}} = \boxed{ 1.97 } $$

## Solutions

d. We ask:
    - Is the population normally distributed (i.e. are housing prices in *GauchoVille* normally distributed)? No.
    - Is our sample size large enough? Yes; $n = 37 \geq 30$.
    - Do we have $\sigma$ or $s$? We have $s$.
    
- Therefore, we use a _t_-distribution with $n - 1 = 37 - 1 = 36$ degrees of freedom:
$$ \boxed{\mathrm{TS} \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} t_{36} } $$

## Solutions {style="font-size:32px"}

e. From the _t_-table provided on the website (which will also be provided to you during the exam), the critical value is \boxed{2.03}. \

f. Since $|\mathrm{TS}| = |1.97| = 1.97 < 2.03$, we fail to reject the null:

:::{.fragment}
> At a 5\% level of significance, there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the true monthly cost of a 1-bedroom apartment in *GauchoVille* is \$1.1k in favor of the alternative that the true cost is *not* \$1.1k. 
:::

g. The code we would use, after importing `scipy.stats`, is `2 * scipy.stats.t.cdf(-1.97, 36)`, which we would expect to be *larger* than 5\% as we failed to reject based on the critical value, and we only reject when _p_ is less than $\alpha$ (which is 5\% for this problem).

# Two-Sample _t_-Test

## Two Samples

- The above discussion was in regards to a *single* sample, taken from a *single* population.

- What happens if we have *two* populations, goverend by parameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$.

- For example, suppose we want to compare the average air pollution in Santa Barbara to that in Los Angeles.

- That is, given two populations (Population 1 and Population 2) with population means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, we would like to test some claim involving both $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.

## Two Samples

- For this class, we only ever consider a null of the form $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$; i.e. that the two populations have the same average.

- We do still have two alternative hypotheses available to us:

    - $H_A: \ \mu_1 < \mu_2$
    - $H_A: \ \mu_1 > \mu_2$

- Remember that the trick is to reparameterize everything to be in terms of a *difference* of parameters, thereby reducing the *two*-parameter problem into a *one*-parameter problem.

## Two-Sided

- For example, suppose we are testing the following hypotheses:
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 
  H_0:    & \mu_1 = \mu_2   \\
  H_A:    & \mu_1 \neq \mu_2
\end{array} \right. $$

- We can define $\delta = \mu_2 - \mu_1$, and equivalently re-express our hypotheses as
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rr} 
  H_0:    & \delta = 0   \\
  H_A:    & \delta \neq 0
\end{array} \right. $$

## Test Statistic

- Now, we need some sort of test statistic.

- Suppose we have a (representative) sample $x = \{x_i\}_{i=1}^{n_1}$ from Population 1 and a (representative) sample $y = \{y_i\}_{i=1}^{n_2}$ from Population 2 (note the potentially different sample sizes!)

- We have an inkling that a decent point estimator for $\delta = \mu_2 - \mu_1$ is $\widehat{\delta} = \overline{Y} - \overline{X}$.

- Our test statistic will be some standardized form of $\widehat{\delta}$, meaning we need to find $\mathbb{E}[\widehat{\delta}]$ and $\mathrm{SD}(\widehat{\delta})$.

## Linear Combinations of Random Variables

- Our two main results are:

    1) $\mathbb{E}[aX + bY + c] = a \cdot \mathbb{E}[X] + b \cdot \mathbb{E}[Y] + c$
    2) $\mathrm{Var}(aX + bY + c) = a^2 \cdot \mathrm{Var}(X) + b^2 \cdot \mathrm{Var}(Y)$, for independent random variables $X$ and $Y$.
    
- Since $\mathbb{E}[\overline{Y}] = \mu_2$ and $\mathbb{E}[\overline{X}] = \mu_1$, we have that
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[\widehat{\delta}]    & = \mathbb{E}[\overline{Y} - \overline{X}]    \\
    & = \mathbb{E}[\overline{Y}] - \mathbb{E}[\overline{X}]   \\
    & = \mu_2 - \mu_1 = \delta
\end{align*}
which effectively shows that $\widehat{\delta}$ is a "good" point estimator of $\delta$.

## Linear Combinations of Random Variables

- Additionally, since
$$ \mathrm{Var}(\overline{X}) = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1}; \qquad \mathrm{Var}(\overline{Y}) = \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2} $$
we have
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{Var}(\widehat{\delta})    & = \mathrm{Var}(\overline{Y} - \overline{X})   \\
    & = \mathrm{Var}(\overline{Y}) + \mathrm{Var}(\overline{X})   \\
    & = \frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}
\end{align*}

## Test Statistic {style="font-size:32px"}

- This led us to consider the following test statistic:
$$ \mathrm{TS}_1 = \frac{\overline{Y} - \overline{X}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}} $$ 
which, under the null, would follow a standard normal distribution if $\overline{X}$ and $\overline{Y}$ both followed a normal distribution.

- However, in many situations, we won't have access to the population variances $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$. Rather, we will only have access to the *sample* variances $s_X^2$ and $s_Y^2$. Hence, we modify our test statistic to be of the form
$$ \mathrm{TS} = \frac{\overline{Y} - \overline{X}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2}}} $$ 

## Distribution of the Test Statistic {style="font-size:32px"}

- This statistic is no longer normally distributed under the null.

- It *approximately* follows a _t_ distribution with degrees of freedom given by the Satterthwaite Approximation:
$$ \mathrm{df} = \mathrm{round}\left\{ \frac{ \left[ \left( \frac{s_X^2}{n_1} \right) + \left( \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2} \right) \right]^2 }{ \frac{\left( \frac{s_X^2}{n_1} \right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{\left( \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{n_2 - 1} } \right\} $$

- That is;
$$ \mathrm{TS} \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} t_{\mathrm{df}}; \quad \text{df given by above}$$

## Test {style="font-size:32px"}

- If we are conducting a two-sided hypothesis test, then both large *positive* values *and* large *negative* values of our test statistic would lead credence to the null over the alternative. 

    - As such, our test would reject for large values of $|\mathrm{TS}|$
    
- If instead our alternative took the form $\mu_1 < \mu_2$; i.e. that $\delta = \mu_2 - \mu_1 > 0$, our test would reject for large positive values of $\mathrm{TS}$.

- If instead our alternative took the form $\mu_1 > \mu_2$; i.e. that $\delta = \mu_2 - \mu_1 < 0$, our test would reject for large negative values of $\mathrm{TS}$.

- Again, the key is to note that after reparameterizing the problem to be in terms of the difference $\delta = \mu_2 - \mu_1$, the problem becomes a familiar one-parameter problem.

## Worked-Out Example 2

:::{.nonincremental}
::: {style="font-size: 22px"}
A renter wants to know which city is cheaper to live in: *GauchoVille* or *Bruin City*. Specifically, she would like to test the null hypothesis that the two cities have the same average monthly rent against the alternative that *GauchoVille* has a higher average monthly rent. \

As such, she takes a representative sample of 32 houses from *GauchoVille* (which she calls Population 1) and 32 houses from *Bruin City* (which she calls Population 2), and records the following information about her samples (all values are reported in thousands of dollars):

$$\begin{array}{r|cc}
                    & \text{Sample Average}     & \text{Sample Standard Deviation}    \\
  \hline
  \textbf{GauchoVille}  &     3.2                    & 0.50        \\
  \textbf{Bruin City}   &     3.5                    & 0.60
\end{array}$$

a. Write down the null and alternative hypotheses, taking care to define any relevant parameter(s).
b. Compute the value of the test statistic.
c. Assuming the null is correct, what is the distribution of the test statistic? Be sure to include any/all relevant parameter(s)! (Assume all independence and normality conditions are met.)
d. What is the critical value of the test, if we are to use a 5\% level of significance?
e. Conduct the relevant test at a 5\% level of significance, and report your conclusions in the context of the problem.

## Solutions

a. Let $\mu_1$ denote the true average monthly rent in Population 1 (*GauchoVille*) and let $\mu_2$ denote the true average monthly rent in Population 2 (*Bruin City*). Then, the null and alternative hypotheses can be phrased as:
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rr}
  H_0:    & \mu_1 = \mu_2   \\
  H_A:    & \mu_1 < \mu_2 
\end{array} \right. $$
which, phrased in terms of the difference $\mu_2 - \mu_1$, is equivalent to
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rr}
  H_0:    & \mu_2 - \mu_1 = 0   \\
  H_A:    & \mu_2 - \mu_1 > 0
\end{array} \right. $$


## Solutions

b. We compute

:::{.fragment style="text-align:center"}
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{TS}   & = \frac{\overline{Y} - \overline{X}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_X^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2}}} \\
    & = \frac{3.5 - 3.2}{\sqrt{\frac{0.5^2}{32} + \frac{0.6^2}{32}  }} \approx \boxed{2.173} 
\end{align*}
:::


## Solutions {style="font-size:30px"}

c. We know that, under the null, the test statistic (assuming all independence and normality conditions hold) follows a _t_-distribution with degrees of freedom given by the Satterthwaite Approximation. As such, we should first compute the degrees of freedom:


:::{.fragment style="text-align:center"}
\begin{align*}
  \mathrm{df}   & = \mathrm{round}\left\{ \frac{ \left[ \left( \frac{s_X^2}{n_1} \right) + \left( \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2} \right) \right]^2 }{ \frac{\left( \frac{s_X^2}{n_1} \right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{\left( \frac{s_Y^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{n_2 - 1} } \right\} \\
    & = \mathrm{round}\left\{ \frac{ \left[ \left( \frac{0.5^2}{32} \right) + \left( \frac{0.6^2}{32} \right) \right]^2 }{ \frac{\left( \frac{0.5^2}{32} \right)^2}{32 - 1} + \frac{\left( \frac{0.6^2}{32} \right)^2}{32 - 1} } \right\} \\
    & = \mathrm{round}\{60.04737\} = 60
\end{align*}
:::

- Therefore, $\mathrm{TS} \stackrel{H_0}{\sim} t_{60}$

d. Recall that we have an upper-tailed alternative. As such, the critical value will be the $(1 - 0.05) \times 100 = 95$^th^ percentile of the $t_{60}$ distribution. From our table, we see that this is \boxed{1.67}.

e. We reject when our test statistic is larger than the critical value (again, since we are using an upper-tailed alternative). Since $\mathrm{TS} = 2.173 > 1.67$, we **reject the null**:

> At a 5\% level of significance, there was sufficient evidence to reject the null that the average monthly rent in the two cities is the same against the alternative that the average monthly rent in *Bruin City* is higher than that in *GauchoVille*.

- Quick aside: do you think it was a valid assumption to make that the "normality conditions" hold?

# Analysis of Variance

## Multiple Populations

- Suppose, instead of comparing *two* population means, we compare *k* population means $\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_k$.

- This is one framework in which **ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) is useful.

- Given $k$ populations, each assumed to be normally distributed, with means $\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_k$, ANOVA tests the following hypotheses:
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{rl}
  H_0:    & \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k    \\
  H_A:    & \text{at least one of the $\mu_i$'s is different from the others}
\end{array} \right. $$

## ANOVA {style="font-size:30px"}

- Specifically, ANOVA utilizes the so-called **_F_-statistic**
$$ \mathrm{F} = \frac{\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{G}}}{\mathrm{MS}_{E}} $$
where $\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{G}}$, the **mean square between groups**, can be thought of as a measure of variability between group means, and $\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{E}}$, the **mean squared error**, can be thought of as a measure of variability within groups/variability due to chance.

- If $\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{G}}$ is much larger than $\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{E}}$ - i.e. if the variability between groups is much more than what we would expect due to chance alone - we would likely reject the null that all group means were the same. 

    - As such, ANOVA rejects for values of the _F_-statistic that are large (i.e. much greater than 1).
  
## ANOVA {style="font-size:30px"}

- Assuming the $k$ populations follow independent normal distributions, the _F_-statistic follows an **F-distribution** under the null.

    - Specifically, $F \sim F_{k-1, \ n - k}$ where $n$ is the total number of observations across *all* groups.
    
- Since we reject $H_0$ (in favor of $H_A$) whenever $F$ is large, we always compute _p_-values in ANOVA using right-tail probabilities:


:::{.fragment}
```{r, fig.height = 3}
library(tidyverse)
data.frame(x = seq(0, 6, by = 0.01)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = df,
                args = list(3, 10),
                xlim = c(2, 6),
                geom = "area",
                fill = "#a4caeb",
                n = 300) +
  stat_function(fun = df,
                args = list(3, 10),
                linewidth = 1,
                n = 300) +
  theme_economist_white() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect("#f0ebd8"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f0ebd8")
  ) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("")
```

## ANOVA

- The results of an ANOVA are typically displayed by way of an **ANOVA Table**:

:::{.fragment style="font-size:28px"}
|  | **DF** | **Sum Sq** | **Mean Sq** | **F value** | **Pr(>F)** |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Between Groups | $k - 1$	| $\mathrm{SS}_{\mathrm{G}}$	| $\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{G}}$	| _F_	 | _p_-value |
| Residuals | $n - k$	| $\mathrm{SS}_{\mathrm{E}}$	| $\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{E}}$	|
:::

\

- You should familiarize yourself with how these quantities relate to each other; specifically, that
$$ \mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{G}} = \frac{\mathrm{SS}_{\mathrm{G}}}{k - 1} ; \quad \mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{E}} = \frac{\mathrm{SS}_{\mathrm{E}}}{n - k}; \quad F = \frac{\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{G}}}{\mathrm{MS}_{\mathrm{E}}} $$
