To that end, she takes a representative sample of 500 cats and finds that 3.2\\% of cats in this sample have FIV. What is the probability that the proportion of cats that are FIV-positive in her sample of 500 cats lies within 1 percent of the true proportion of FIV-positive cats?\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## Solution {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- Let $p$ denote the true proportion of FIV-positive cats. Let $\\widehat{P}$ denote the proportion of FIV-positive cats in a representative sample of size 500.\n    - Do we know the value of $p$?\n    - No we do not.\n- What we *do* have is $\\widehat{p} = 0.032$.\n    - Therefore, we use the substitution approximation to the success-failure conditions:\n    - $n \\widehat{p} = (500)(0.032) = 16 \\geq 10 \\ \\checkmark$\n    - $n \\widehat{p} (1 - \\widehat{p}) = (500)(1 - 0.032) = 484 \\geq 10 \\ \\checkmark$\n- Since both conditions are met, the CLT tells us\n$$ \\widehat{P} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(p, \\ \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{500}} \\right)$$\n\n## Solution {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- We seek $\\mathbb{P}(p - 0.01 \\leq \\widehat{P} \\leq p + 0.01)$. \n- Our first step is to write this as\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(\\widehat{P} \\leq p + 0.01) - \\mathbb{P}(\\widehat{P} \\leq p - 0.01 ) $$\n- Next, we find the associated $z-$scores:\n\\begin{align*}\n  z_1   & = \\frac{(p + 0.01) - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{500}}}  = \\frac{0.01}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{500}}}    \\\\\n  z_2   & = \\frac{(p + 0.01) - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{500}}} = - \\frac{0.01}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{500}}}  \n\\end{align*}\n\n\n## Solution {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- Now, we can apply the substitution approximation to plug in $\\widehat{p}$ in place of $p$ in the denominator of our $z-$scores to compute\n\\begin{align*}\n  z_{1, \\ \\text{sub}}   & = \\frac{0.01}{\\sqrt{\\frac{(0.032)(1 - (0.032))}{500}}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.00787}  = 1.27  \\\\\n  z_{2, \\ \\text{sub}}   & = - \\frac{0.01}{\\sqrt{\\frac{(0.032)(1 - (0.032))}{500}}} = - \\frac{0.01}{0.00787}  = -1.27\n\\end{align*}\n\n- Finally, consulting our standard normal table, we find the answer to be\n$$ 0.8980 - 0.1020 = \\boxed{0.796 = 79.6\\%} $$\n\n## A Note {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- I'd like to stress that the substitution approximation is just that- an *approximation*.\n- It is **not**, for instance, true that $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{P}] = \\widehat{p}$; the center of the distribution of $\\widehat{P}$ will always (provided the success-failure conditions are met) be $p$, the *true* value of the proportion.\n\n## Leadup {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- Let's quickly take stock of what we've learned.\n- If we have a population with some unknown population parameter $p$, we can repeatedly take representative samples, compute the sample proportion in each sample, and construct the sampling distribution of $\\widehat{P}$.\n- Assuming the success-failure conditions are met, this sampling distribution will be centered at $p$, the true proportion value.\n- Hence, a natural point estimator of $p$ would be $\\widehat{P}$.\n\n## Leadup {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- However, the key assumption in this procedure is our ability to take *multiple samples* from the population.\n\n- In many practical situations, this is not feasible.\n\n- So, here is a new question to consider: given just a *single* sample from the population, what can we say about $p$?\n\n- Well, we've already seen that it's risky to simply take $\\widehat{p}$ (i.e. the value of $\\widehat{P}$ that was observed in the sample we took) to be an estimate of $p$, due to the randomness associated with $\\widehat{P}$.\n\n- Instead of looking for *point* estimates of $p$, what happens if we instead provide *intervals* we believe may contain $p$?\n\n## Leadup {style=\"font-size:28px\"}\n\n- Let's make things a bit more concrete. Since I like cats, let's go back to our veterinarian example:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n>A veterinarian wishes to determine the true proportion of cats that suffer from FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus). To that end, she takes a representative sample of 100 cats and finds that 3.2\\% of cats in this sample have FIV.\n:::\n\n- Again, it's risky to say that \"the true proportion of FIV-positive cats is 3.2\\%\" based solely on this sample.\n\n- Instead, we are going to start proposing *intervals* of values that we believe contain $p$.\n\n- Now, clearly the *strengths* of our beliefs will depend on the interval we provide.\n\n- For example, I am 100\\% confident that the true proportion of FIV-positive cats is somewhere in the interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\n- But, suppose we instead consider the interval $(0.030, \\ 0.034)$; now we can't really say that we're 100\\% certain this interval covers the true value of $p$. \n\n\n## Confidence Intervals {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- This is the basic idea of what are known as **confidence intervals**.\n\n- I particularly like the analogy our textbook (*OpenIntro Statistics*) uses:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n> [...] Using only a point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear. We can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probably miss. On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish.  *(page 181)*\n:::\n\n- For the purposes of this class, we will construct confidence intervals for an arbitrary parameter $\\theta$ (e.g. a population proportion $p$, a population mean $\\mu$, etc.) of the form $\\widehat{\\theta} \\pm \\mathrm{m.e.}$ where $\\widehat{\\theta}$ represents some point estimate of $\\theta$ and $\\mathrm{m.e.}$ represents a **margin of error**.\n\n- So, for the veterinarian example, our confidence interval will be of the form $\\widehat{p} \\pm \\mathrm{m.e.}$.\n\n## Confidence Intervals {style=\"font-size:30px\"}\n\n- Before constructing a confidence interval, however, we need to specify our **confidence level**. In other words, we need first have an idea of how confident we want to be that our interval contains the true parameter value.\n\n- For example, a **95\\% confidence interval** is an interval $\\widehat{\\theta} \\pm \\mathrm{m.e.}$ that we are 95\\% confident covers the true value of $\\theta$.\n\n- Here's a question: based on everything we've talked about thus far, do you think higher confidence levels correspond to *wider* or *narrower* intervals?\n\n    - That's right: the\n    higher our confidence level, the *wider* our interval will be.\n    \n    - As an extreme example, consider again the slightly absurd confidence interval $(-\\infty, \\ \\infty)$; this is a 100\\% confidence interval because we are 100\\% confident that it covers the true value of the parameter!\n\n- So, therein lies the tradeoff: the more confidence we want, the wider we need to make our intervals and the less informative they become in pinning down the true value of the parameter.\n\n## Confidence Intervals for Proportions {style=\"font-size:32px\"}\n\n- Alright, let's return to our considerations on population proportions.\n\n- Again, our confidence interval will take the general form $\\widehat{p} \\pm \\mathrm{m.e.}$. \n\n- It makes sense that the margin of error should include some information about the variability of $\\widehat{P}$. As such, we take our confidence intervals to be of the form\n$$ \\widehat{p} \\pm z_\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt{ \\frac{p(1 - p)}{n} } $$\nwhere $z_{\\alpha}$ is a constant that depends on our confidence level.\n\n## Confidence Intervals for Proportions {style=\"font-size:32px\"}\n\n\n- To see exactly how this dependency manifests itself, let's make things a bit more concrete and consider a 95\\% confidence level. It turns out that this implies\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(-z_\\alpha \\leq Z \\leq z_\\alpha) = 0.95 $$\nwhere $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\ 1)$.\n    - I'll try to post some supplementary material for those of you curious as to why this is- for now, I ask you to just take this fact at face value.\n\n- As always, we draw a picture.\n\n## Confidence Intervals for Proportions {style=\"font-size:32px\"}\n\n- The region we will sketch is the area under the standard normal curve between $-z_\\alpha$ and $z_\\alpha$:\n\n:::{.fragment}\n```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=6, fig.align='center'}\n#| echo: False\ndata.frame(x = c(-3, 3)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x)) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                xlim = c(-1.96, 1.96),\n                geom = \"area\",\n                fill = \"#a4caeb\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, \n                size = 1.5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(-3, 3, by = 0.5), 1)) +\n  theme_economist_white() +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(\"#f0ebd8\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f0ebd8\")\n  ) +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ylim(c(0, 0.6)) +\n  theme(plot.margin = margin(-2, 0, 0, 0, \"cm\"))\n```\n:::\n\n- Now, here's the slightly peculiar thing- in this case, we know that the area itself must be 0.95.
